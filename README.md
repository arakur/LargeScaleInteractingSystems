# Some Implementations for the Large Scale Interacting Systems (for research)

Scripts and modules for the research of the large scale interacting systems with Julia[Julia].
This totally refers to [BKS].

This project is quite under construction and mainly for our own research.
Current status:

- [x] Calculation of the space $\mathrm{Consv}^\phi(S)$ of the conserved quantities
- [ ] Combinatorics of interactions and quantities;
  - [x] enumerating and
  - [ ] counting
- [ ] Other stuffs

## Setting

1. Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (â‰¥ v1.7.2).
2. Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).
3. `git clone "https://github.com/arakur/LargeScaleInteractingSystems"`.
4. Open Jupyter Notebook files `ConservedQuantities.ipynb` and `InteractionsEnumeration.ipynb`.

## Contents

### 1. ConservedQuantities: Calculation a basis of the space $\mathrm{Consv}^\phi(S)$ of the conserved quantities

See the Julia notebook `src/ConservedQuantities.ipynb`.

### 2. InteractionsEnumeration: Enumeration and counting all interactions

See the Julia notebook `src/InteractionsEnumeration.ipynb`.
